# Flux decline plotting

This script is for plotting membrane flux which is declining over time which can occur due to membrane compression or fouling

To run the script, format the data in .csv format for flux_decline_data.csv as below:

Measurement Start time (24hr time),Pressure (bar),Time (mins),Flux 0 (LMH),Flux 1 (LMH),Flux 2 (LMH)
